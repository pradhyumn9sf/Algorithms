It is used when we want to get data (max, min, sum or any other operation over a specific range of elements in an array.)
for queries which is happening on some segment of array.
O(n) to build segment tree
O(n) to maintain segment tree
O(logN) query
root node index -> 0
parent node -> i
left child -> 2i + 1
right child -> 2i + 2

arr = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
                                                                                0[0-9]
                                                  1[0-4]                                                        2[5-9]
                                    3[0-2]                       4[3-4]                            5[5-7]                      6[8-9]
                             7[0-1]         8[2-2]        9[3-3]        10[4-4]            11[5-6]       12[7-7]     12[8-8]          13[9-9]
